# CommandWork (`cmd_wrk`)
### A framework for writing commands as native functions.

## This project is very WIP. Contributions welcome.

This project has 3 objectives:
- **Write commands as code.** Commands should not need any user-written glue prior to performing business logic.
- **Adaptable and agnostic.** This crate shouldn't enforce any design decisions, and should be usable for any context where commands need to be processed.
- **As easy to learn as to use.** There should be an absolute minimal learning curve to picking up this crate.

## Credit
Inspiration for this project comes from [Discord.Net.Commands v1/2](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net), which was inspired by ASP.NET.
